Titanium CLI 8.0.0 is a small maintenance release that drops support for
Node.js 18 and older. In accordance with semantic versioning, dropping
Node.js 18 is considered a breaking change. The Titanium CLI now officially
supports Node.js 20.18.1+, 22.x, and 24.x.

We also updated the CLI's npm dependencies.

## Install

**To install 8.0.0, run:**

```
[sudo] npm i -g titanium
```
